Based on https://github.com/plotly/dash-auth
With few small but for crucial changes for me

Crucial:
	Usage seems to require some additional resources that
	are not automatically available, such as ua_parser
	(which is from package ua-parser - mind the dash instead
	of underscore!)
	Two-three options:
		The one I did and worked, though pbly stupid:
			FIRST temporarily install
			the original dash-auth (from package manager, e.g.
			for py with virtualenv in CLion) and then uninstall,
			so that somehow e.g.
				from ua_parser import user_agent_parser
			works properly.
		Pbly more natural:
			Well simply install the package ua-parser and co.,
			whichever you first get complaint about them missing
		Maybe nicest:
			Check the dev-requirements.txt that I still keep
			from the original dash-auth package, and see what's
			required (or even: adapt it to your needs and have
			virtualenv get these requirements??)
